install notes for https://github.com/hansehv/SamplerBox on a raspberry pi 5

hello all, this is a place for me to organize how i installed hansehv's most recent version of SamplerBox on a Raspberry Pi 5 (i think it was compatible with up till RPI3 or 4).

long story short, there is a couple of dependencies which are a bit finnicky to install, and i modified some of the code to get rid of depreciated stuff.

**install notes will follow here in the next few days **
